\section*{Proposal Study Planner - Collaboration}

\section{Executive Summary}

Summary of proposal(300 words): Your proposal in a few sentences. Include: Objectives, Significance, and brief description of Proposed Work. A comment on anticipated outcomes (deliverable).

Brain Tumor is an abnormal growth
This study proposes a Deep learning Network that exploit self-attention mechanism for brain tumor detection. 



\section{Survey of Background Literature}

\subsection{Overview}

Give Context and brief argument for the need for progress in this research area and what you propose to do, in simple, non-technical terms (for the benefit of non-technical experts). Also briefly emphasize the impact and outcomes from thus work in tangible terms, such as societal benefits
\subsection{Background}

Give a thorough introduction to the background science relevant to the general area of the proposed research (Much of this come from the review). Explain any relevant theory and standard techniques used in the area, along with any acronyms and jargon typical to the field. Also provide background material on any new methodologies if you intend to introduce to the field. Remember that it is always better avoid the use of abbreviations and acronyms as much as possible

\subsection{Relevance/Impact}

In the context provided by the background science, layout the argument that justifies the need for research in this area. Point out the significance of these works to the field, and practice. Comment on its potential impact on the development of the scientific area and the society/sector as a whole. What are we going to learn? Why is it important to learn this? How will this new knowledge translate benefits to the sector/society such as economic impact, improvement in quality of life, career, improvement in environment, improvement and closing the gender gap in ICT ,. etc etc...

\section{Proposed Methodology}
Outline the experimental and theoretical methods specific to the proposed research. Justify the choice of methods as opposed to alternatives. Avoid giving too much detailed information; just outline the general approach and why you chose to use them

\section{Research Plan}
State the long - and short -term objectives of your research program. Outline specific projects planned to meet these goals, including the timelines for completion of each stage, methods to be used, and dissemination of results. 

\section{Resources}
Provide details on the instrumentation and materials needed, along with the estimates of human resources required for each project/activity throughout the lifetime of the project
